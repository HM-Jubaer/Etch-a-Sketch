# Etch-a-Sketch

This is an interactive Etch-a-Sketch project where you can draw on a grid of squares by hovering your mouse over them. The squares change color when you hover over them, with the added feature of progressively darkening the squares with each interaction. The grid size can be customized by clicking the "Reset" button and entering a new size (max 100).
